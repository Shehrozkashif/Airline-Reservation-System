# Airline Reservation System

A desktop-based **Airline Reservation System** built using **Java Swing** for the frontend and **JDBC** for backend database operations. This application allows users to manage flight bookings, passenger details, flight schedules, and more in a user-friendly GUI.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: New users can register, and existing users can log in.
- **Flight Search**: Search for available flights by specifying departure and arrival locations.
- **Book a Flight**: Users can book a flight, selecting available seats and inputting passenger details.
- **Cancel Bookings**: Easy cancellation of existing flight bookings.
- **View Booking History**: Users can view their past bookings and transaction details.
- **Flight Management (Admin)**: Admin users can add, edit, or delete flights, manage flight schedules, and monitor bookings.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Java Swing for creating the graphical user interface.
- **Backend**: Java with JDBC for database connectivity and CRUD operations.
- **Database**: MySQL (or another RDBMS of your choice).
- **Development Environment**: NetBeans IDE.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- NetBeans IDE (or any other preferred IDE for Java development)
- MySQL (or your chosen database) with proper configuration
- JDBC Driver for MySQL (or appropriate JDBC driver for your database)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airline-reservation-system.git
    ```

2. Open the project in NetBeans (or your preferred Java IDE).

3. Configure the database:
   - Install MySQL and create a database for the application.
   - Run the provided SQL scripts (if available) to set up the necessary tables.
   - Update the JDBC connection URL, username, and password in the code to match your MySQL database configuration.
   
   Example in your JDBC connection class:
   ```java
   String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your-database-name";
   String username = "your-username";
   String password = "your-password";
   ```

4. Build and run the project in NetBeans.

## Usage

1. **Login/Registration**: Use the registration screen to create a new user account or log in with an existing account.

2. **Flight Search & Booking**: Enter your desired flight details (departure and arrival locations, dates), and select a flight to book seats.

3. **Manage Bookings**: View, modify, or cancel your bookings from the “My Bookings” section.

4. **Admin Functionality**: Admin users have access to an admin panel to manage flights, view all reservations, and modify flight schedules.
